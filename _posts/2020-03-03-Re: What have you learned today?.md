<p><span>Dear Web,</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I’m addicted to building things. Yes, I built another app. This time, it’s a tool to help you write more consistently in public, which is something I think most people should try. Why? Because thinking in public
 allows you to synthesize your thoughts, articulate it to an audience, and validate your ideas. If it’s not validation you’re looking for, then sharing something you know can be useful to others. In a knowledge economy, the more you know and share, the easier
 it is to make your services appealing. But none of this matters without <u>consistency</u>, which brings me to my second point: Why is consistency so important?</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Consistency is the gold-standard mechanism for building an audience / client list, whatever you want to call it. The best sales guy I’ve ever met had two main principles – always stay in touch, always communicate.
 The keyword, being “ALWAYS”. If you don’t let people in your network know what you are doing, how will you convey your skills and interests? How will someone remember to reach out to you if it’s been 2 years since you’ve spoken to them? Staying top of mind
 is key to running a successful business and it doesn’t always require a dialogue. You want people to think of you first for anything related to your line of services – putting your word out there will keep people interested in what you are doing, even if it’s
 simple update.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>So more on the app, we’ve built: Franklin. Franklin, named after the first postmaster general of the U.S., Ben Franklin, allows you to email your blog posts. Flat out. It’s currently available for anyone who runs
 their blog on Jekyll. We’re working on other static site generators. If you don’t have a blog / don’t know what any of this is, we want to help. The app is in beta. If you’re interested in building an audience and working towards writing more consistency,
 please indicate your interest here: <a><span>https://small-web-llc.ck.page/09f8f55667</span></a></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>So why email?</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>Email is a familiar
 tool.</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>You take care of email
 correspondence. When you hit the send button, that message is being sent to someone who will read it. You want to make sure that email is 1) useful, 2) accurate and 3) concise for the reader. We wanted to capture that here with Franklin.</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>Why build another bloated
 app for you to manage your blog posts. Just get the message out there quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Who is this for?</span></p>
<ul><li>Anyone who finds the current process for releasing a blog post on a static site generator frustrating.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who NEEDs to get their content out more consistently. Franklin sends reminders to post, “e.g. what have you learned today”.</li>
<li>Anyone trying to build an audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Right now, we’re still working on the pricing model, so if you’re willing to be the guinea pig for this, we’ll grandfather you into the pricing that we have established on the site when that time comes, although
 our goal is to make this 100% free for our largest population of users. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>All feedback is welcome.  </span></p>
