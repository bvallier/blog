<body><div class="WordSection1"><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Dear Web,<p></p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black"> <p></p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">I’m addicted to building things. Yes, I built another app. This time, it’s a tool to help you write more consistently in public, which is something I think most people should try. Why? Because thinking in public  allows you to synthesize your thoughts, articulate it to an audience, and validate your ideas. If it’s not validation you’re looking for, then sharing something you know can be useful to others. In a knowledge economy, the more you know and share, the easier  it is to make your services appealing. But none of this matters without <u>consistency</u>, which brings me to my second point: Why is consistency so important?<p></p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black"> <p></p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Consistency is the gold-standard mechanism for building an audience / client list, whatever you want to call it. The best sales guy I’ve ever met had two main principles – always stay in touch, always communicate.  The keyword, being “ALWAYS”. If you don’t let people in your network know what you are doing, how will you convey your skills and interests? How will someone remember to reach out to you if it’s been 2 years since you’ve spoken to them? Staying top of mind  is key to running a successful business and it doesn’t always require a dialogue. You want people to think of you first for anything related to your line of services – putting your word out there will keep people interested in what you are doing, even if it’s  simple update.<p></p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black"> <p></p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">So more on the app, we’ve built: Franklin. Franklin, named after the first postmaster general of the U.S., Ben Franklin, allows you to email your blog posts. Flat out. It’s currently available for anyone who runs  their blog on Jekyll. We’re working on other static site generators. If you don’t have a blog / don’t know what any of this is, we want to help. The app is in beta.
