Very recently, I've decided to build a blog. I was deciding on a couple of different platforms (e.g. wordpress) and decided that 
i wanted something simple, expressive and static. I had previously used [Stacey][stacey] and fell in love with her, but more recently i
have been building things in ruby on rails, and wanted a tool i could switch to easily in my vagrant box, when i felt like "blogging".

At any rate, i was looking for some themes i could "borrow", but none quite met my design-backward ways. I thought it would be nice to
provide some here, in one fancy listicle.

Without further ado, my listicle of great jekyll blogs:

**If you are interested in this particular jekyll theme, i will be pushing this theme to github in the near future. Feel free to add 
your email to my list and I'll let you know when it's up. Thanks.**
