I discovered this great app which allows you to create and publish posts on your phone, called Octopage. I'm not really sure how often I'll use it but seems great for short snippet thoughts and embedding some photos while on the run. I'll first need to grab the image-tag library from octopress and use that to link to photos on my drop box account. Should be cool - stay tuned, and I will walk you through how I blog from my phone!
