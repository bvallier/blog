My name is brice. i've been developing on the web for 10+ years and everyday i am inspired by the potential of web tech,
hardware hacks, software design principles, humble people, and those who actually post and answer questions on stack overflow. 
Thanks, btw. 

I spend my spare time (ermmm, all my time) consulting for pharma, med device and healthcare companies, mainly implementing web 
and data-centered solutions and analytics to solve their funnest problems.
 
I like good twitter followers: [https://twitter.com/wireblitz](https://twitter.com/wireblitz)
