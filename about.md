Brice Vallieres

I am a web and data analytics consultant living in Washington, DC. I've been developing on the web for 12+ years and have provided professional consulting services for 7 of those years. My interests to-date have focused on de-risking pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers by creating data-driven software and analytical solutions to target risk signals for my clients.

My current focus is to develop software and analytical solutions for GREAT clients looking to solve specific, socially-conscious, hard-to-reach problems. I am interested in working with people who have well-framed concepts, and just need a little assistance in executing an idea or automating a process. I am big into productivity!
